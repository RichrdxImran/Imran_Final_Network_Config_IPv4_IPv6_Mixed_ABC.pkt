# Imran Final Version – IPv4, IPv6, and Mixed Network Configuration (ABC Topology)

This Cisco Packet Tracer project demonstrates a structured, hybrid network topology using IPv4, IPv6, and mixed (dual-stack) configurations across three different network segments: A, B, and C.

## 🧠 Objective

The purpose of this project is to showcase:
- Proper IP addressing schemes (IPv4, IPv6, and dual-stack)
- End-to-end connectivity within and between segments
- Effective use of routing protocols and static routes
- Practical implementation of networking concepts in a simulated enterprise environment

---

## 🗂️ Topology Overview

- **Segment A:** IPv4-only configuration  
- **Segment B:** IPv6-only configuration  
- **Segment C:** Dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6)

All segments are interconnected using routers and switches, allowing communication between different IP versions via proper routing and configuration.

---

## 🔧 Features and Configuration

- ✅ IPv4 subnetting and addressing (Segment A)
- ✅ IPv6 unicast addressing and stateless address autoconfiguration (Segment B)
- ✅ Dual-stack setup with both IPv4 and IPv6 on interfaces (Segment C)
- ✅ Static and/or dynamic routing (RIP, RIPng, OSPFv3 if applicable)
- ✅ Ping and connectivity testing
- ✅ VLANs and switch configuration (if included)

## 📁 Files Included

- `Imran_Final_Network_Config_IPv4_IPv6_Mixed_ABC.pkt` — Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the complete network setup.

---

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Download and install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/portal/resources/packet-tracer) (latest version recommended).
2. Open the `.pkt` file.
3. Observe the topology and try testing device connectivity.
4. Explore configurations on routers, switches, and PCs.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Build and manage networks using both IPv4 and IPv6
- Understand and apply dual-stack networking
- Practice static/dynamic routing in mixed environments
- Configure end devices, switches, and routers in a simulated network
